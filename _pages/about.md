My name is Taylor, and I'm a Cyber Security enthusiast trying to learn as much as I can in order to become a penetration tester. I really didn't know at first how I wanted to structure this site, but I knew I wanted a mix of my own experiences as well as use this as an opportunity to teach people about cyber security and why it's important. I've always felt like there isn't much transparency between the end user and the various security programs/platforms that we use every day. Cyber Security is a field that has grown tremendously, and it is always constantly changing. Hopefully you, the reader, can walk away knowing a little bit more and be able to speak about cyber security in a way that's more that just, "well it works." 

If there are any specific topics you want me to cover, just let me know! The end goal is to also have a youtube page setup that goes over most of what is on this site.
