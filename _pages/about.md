My name is Taylor, and I'm a cyber security analyst trying to learn as much as I can. My main goal is to become a penetration tester eventually.

IThe purpose of this blog/site is to use this as an opportunity to teach people about cyber security, and why it's important. I've always felt like there isn't much transparency between the end user and the various security programs/platforms that we use every day. Cyber security is a field that has grown tremendously, and it is always constantly changing. Hopefully you, the reader, can walk away knowing a little bit more and be able to speak about cyber security in a way that's more that just, "well it works." 

If there are any specific topics you want me to cover, just let me know! Happy hacking!
