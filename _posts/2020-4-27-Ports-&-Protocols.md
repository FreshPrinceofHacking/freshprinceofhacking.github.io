This article is supplementary to the Nmap section in [Kali Tools](https://freshprinceofhacking.github.io/capture%20the%20flag/pentesting/Kali-Tools/). If you're going to be following the CTF guide on here or elsewhere, you're still going to have to know about ports and protocols. 

### So what are Ports and Protocols?

If you think about your computer and the various tasks it does, there has to be a reason why it all seems so seamless. Your computer not only has to know what it's communicating with, but more importantly HOW to communicate with other devices/services. Establishing a communication method or protocol, will allow devices to interact with each other in a meaningful way. For humans, we have a similar structure. We've all probably experienced a time where we couldn't understand what the other person way trying to say, which made the conversation difficult.
