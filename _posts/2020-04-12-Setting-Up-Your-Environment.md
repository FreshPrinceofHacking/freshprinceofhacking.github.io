# Programs you will need

* A linux, mac or Windows machine 
* Virtualization software (VMware, Virtualbox)
* Kali Linux, Parrot Security or your favorite security linux distro

I have all 3 operating systems on different machines, but I'll be using my linux machine for these articles. I will also be using Virtualbox and Kali Linux for my virtual set up. It is alright if you use other programs, but all screenshots will be of Kali Linux and Virtualbox. 

### Setting up Virtualbox

First thing you'll need to do is set up your virtualized environment.

What is virtulization? Essentially, this is way to emulate other operating systems on your computer without having to buy specific hardware tied to that operating system. Long gone are the days where you'd have to buy another computer with an operating system pre-installed in order to see how it works. Now you can use your existing computer's resources and create a virtualized environment of pretty much any opertating system you can think of. 

If you go to the [Virtual Box downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), you will be presented with this page:
