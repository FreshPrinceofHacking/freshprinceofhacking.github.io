Well just like the title says, we're going to hack wifi in this article. It's a lot easier than you'd think. Remember, this is just a proof of concept. I'll be hacking my own wifi connection.

### Scenario

We want to hack wifi. Pretty simple. Our target machine sits behind this wifi access point, and we'll need to establish some presence on the network in order to gain access. Once on the network, we can continue our hacking exploits.

### Concept

Wifi networks are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Most notably, the way in which we're going to be hacking wifi is through a semi-involved **dictionary attack**. Yes, bad passwords are going to be key for this attack to work. If you're unsure about password security in general, please read my ["How Safe is my Password"](https://freshprinceofhacking.github.io/privacy,%20security%20&%20safety/How-Safe-Is-My-Password/) article.
