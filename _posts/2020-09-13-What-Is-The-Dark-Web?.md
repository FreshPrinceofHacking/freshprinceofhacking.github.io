Lately I feel like I've seen and heard the dark web being brought up in more mainstream conversations about data security. Most notably, "Dark web scanning" has been a major marketing selling point that various companies have claimed that they can do to notify you if your information is on the dark web. Ok...but what the hell is the dark web? Hint, it's not dark mode chrome, or a place that black people visit often. All jokes aside, we're going to explore what the dark web is, and hopefully after reading this you'll have a better understanding of what exactly this means in relation to cyber security.

### Let's Jump In The Deep End

In order to better understand what the dark web is, we have to first understand what the web is. You right now are on the World Wide Web. This is the collection of resources or pages interlinked through the HTTP protocol that are accessible over the internet. The internet and WWW are NOT THE SAME THING. The internet was created almost 50 years ago by the military, whereas the world wide web wasn't invented until 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. The best analogy for differentiating the internet and WWW is imagining a city. Think of all of various roads, pipes, etc. that are needed to sustain the infrastructure of the city. This is the internet. Now imagine all of the different storefronts, businesses, etc. where people can visit. This is the WWW. You used a "road" on internet to get you to this "storefront," which is this website.
