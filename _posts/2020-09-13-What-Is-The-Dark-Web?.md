Lately I feel like I've seen and heard the dark web being brought up in more mainstream conversations about data security. Most notably, "Dark web scanning" has been a major marketing selling point that various companies have claimed that they can do to notify you if your information is on the dark web. Ok...but what the hell is the dark web? Hint, it's not dark mode google chrome, or a place on the web that only black people visit. All jokes aside, we're going to explore what the dark web is, and hopefully after reading this you'll have a better understanding of what exactly this means in relation to cyber security.

### Let's Jump In The Deep End

In order to better understand what the dark web is, we have to first understand what the normal web is. You right now are on the World Wide Web. This is the collection of resources or pages interlinked through the HTTP protocol that are accessible over the internet. The internet and WWW are NOT THE SAME THING. The internet was created almost 50 years ago by the military, whereas the world wide web wasn't invented until 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. The best analogy for differentiating the internet and WWW is imagining a city. Think of all of various roads, pipes, etc. that are needed to sustain the infrastructure of the city. This is the internet. Now imagine all of the different storefronts, businesses, etc. where people can visit. This is the WWW. You used a "road" on internet to get you to this "storefront," which is this website. Pretty simple! 

We've all used google before to search for information on the internet. Google is acting as your guide or map on the various roads to get you to your destination. It's just a search engine. But how does google or any search engine know how to point you in the right direction? What they're really doing is **indexing** various pages on internet and presenting them to you based off of your search query. Why is this important? With indexing, we can organize and present content in a reasonable way for the end user to access. Google indexes A LOT of websites/information through their various algorithms, which is what makes them the multi billion dollar company they are. It truly is amazing how much content there is out there. What about the content you can't find on google though? Hmm...  

You may have heard the term "deep web" before. If you haven't, I'm sure you've seen the picture or heard of the analogy of the true amount of content out there on the internet as represented by an iceberg. The surface below the iceberg, where the majority of it is, represents the "deep web." The surface represents....the surface web. Now remembering what search engines do by indexing content, the "deep web" is nothing more than the content that has NOT been indexed. You might be thinking, "Well isn't that a bad thing?" Not necessarily. There's actually a lot of content on the deep web that we don't want indexed....like our bank account information. While (insert your bank here) main website may be indexed to be easily found, the content behind your actual account information is considered to be part of the deep web. This is why the deep web accounts for the majority of all web traffic. Every website you've ever authenticated to has your content hidden behind the deep web. Considering how powerful google is and the insane amount of information they index, I think this is a fair trade off.
