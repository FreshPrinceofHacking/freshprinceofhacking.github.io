Lately I feel like I've seen and heard the dark web being brought up in more mainstream conversations about data security. Most notably, "Dark web scanning" has been a major marketing selling point that various companies have claimed that they can do to notify you if your information is on the dark web. Ok...but what the hell is the dark web? Hint, it's not dark mode google chrome, or a place on the web that only black people visit. All jokes aside, we're going to explore what the dark web is, and hopefully after reading this you'll have a better understanding of what exactly this means in relation to cyber security.

### Let's Jump In The Deep End

In order to better understand what the dark web is, we have to first understand what the normal web is. You right now are on the **World Wide Web**. This is the collection of resources or pages interlinked through the HTTP protocol that are accessible over the internet. The internet and WWW are NOT THE SAME THING. The internet was created almost 50 years ago by the military, whereas the world wide web wasn't invented until 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. The best analogy for differentiating the internet and WWW is imagining a city. Think of all of various roads, pipes, etc. that are needed to sustain the infrastructure of the city. This is the internet. Now imagine all of the different storefronts, businesses, etc. where people can visit. This is the WWW. You used a "road" on internet to get you to this "storefront," which is this website. Pretty simple! 

We've all used google before to search for information on the internet. Google is acting as your guide or map on the various roads to get you to your destination. It's just a search engine. But how does google or any search engine know how to point you in the right direction? What they're really doing is **indexing** various pages on internet and presenting them to you based off of your search query. Why is this important? With indexing, we can organize and present content in a reasonable way for the end user to access. Google indexes A LOT of websites/information through their various algorithms, which is what makes them the multi billion dollar company they are. It truly is amazing how much content there is out there. What about the content you can't find on google though? Hmm...  

You may have heard the term "**deep web**" before. If you haven't, I'm sure you've seen the picture or heard of the analogy of the true amount of content out there on the internet as represented by an iceberg(see below). The area below the surface of the iceberg, where the majority of it is, represents the deep web. The surface represents....the surface web. Now remembering what search engines do by indexing content, the deep web is nothing more than the content that has NOT been indexed. 

You might be thinking, "Wouldn't we want to index everything?" And that's a fair point.

There's actually a lot of content on the web that we don't want indexed....like our bank account information. While (insert your bank here) main website may be indexed to be easily found, the content behind your actual account information is considered to be part of the deep web. This is why the deep web accounts for the majority of all web content. I'm sure you can think of other examples of deep web content in your every day use of the web. Considering how powerful google is and the insane amount of information they index, it's interesting to think what truly is out there...

### Come To The Dark Side

If you've made it this far, you're probably pissed how I always leave the good parts for later in articles. Well, too bad. In fact, if you were really mad at me, you could probably hack me and put my information on the dark web to sell, along with potentially millions of other peoples' information. Before you do that, I still have to tell you what the dark web is and how to find it. 3-5 more minutes of reading, TOPS. I promise ;) 

So we've already established that the deep web is just the non-indexed content out there on world wide web. So what is the dark web specifically? Well, if you've heard the rumors about the content on the dark web, you might guess that it most certainly is not and DOES NOT want to be indexed for everyone to see. It's really just a subset of the deep web, with some special circumstances. Illicit activities ranging from drug sales, hiring hitmen, and purchashing stolen credit information is all fair game on the dark web. In almost a weird way, these people need to be protected too. Cyber security can't exist soley for the good guys. You can bet that the bad people are using whatever advanced cyber security tactics in order to stay hidden and continue to operate efficiently. 

To keep it short, the dark web can be accessed by using special software that is capable of connecting to the domains that host the illicit content. Most notably, the **TOR browser** is infamous for being the gate keeper to acess this content. I'll have a seperate article on what Tor is in more detail, but for now just imagine the Tor software as a way to access the dark web. This software is free and is available to [download from its main site](https://www.torproject.org/). 

**Warning!** Do not download Tor or try to access the content on the dark web unless you know what you're doing. There is a reason why it is hidden, and worst case you will end up potentially in jail, but most likely will get your computer compromised due to the TONS of malware hosted on these sites.

A question to ponder in the meantime, "Why would this software be available to download to the public if it's that bad?" All things will be explained in time...and in another article. 

### Ok, But Does All This Really Matter?

Umm...YES. People have their information compromised every day. If we really spent all the time worrying about what was actually out there, we would curl up in a ball and cry nonstop. The best thing that we as good cyber citizens can do is at least know what is out there, but more importantly know how to protect ourselves. 

This brings me back to my first point at the beginning of the article. You probably have heard of some kind of "dark web scanning" offered by some security company that will inform you when your information has been seen on the dark web. That's great and all, but realistically it's more gimmicky and more of a marketing tactic to get you to buy their service. Suppose Company X has their data stolen and it gets hosted on the dark web. If it's your credit card information, what can you do? If it's your address, email and date of birth, there's nothing you can do either. Sure, the service may tell you they found it somewhere on the dark web, but that doesn't help you protect your information. That's already out the window. There's probably a high chance some of you reading this, including myself have information out there on the dark web. I'm not saying what these companies are offering is bad. I just want you the reader to have some understanding of what it is you're paying your hard earned money for, and be able to speak somewhat intelligently about these subjects.

If anything, there's more pressure on companies to protect this information more so than the user, and there definitely should be. We trust these companies with our personal information that can be used to essentially ruin our lives if used in a nefarious way. As the threats evolve in cyber space, more money and resources are going to have to go towards security programs for these companies to ensure that your data is secure. However, knowing how to protect your information as is on your own, is what I think is the most important piece. Having good passwords, not clicking on random links/attachments in emails, viewing/downloading content from trusted vendors and having some common sense can go a long way in protecting yourself on the internet. The dark web is out there and is scary as hell, but unless you're a malicious hacker, bad person or just a curious George, you'll never see this content. 

Thank you for reading!
