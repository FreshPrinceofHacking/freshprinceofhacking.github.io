This question is probably one that is most asked when it comes to ensuring your various accounts are secure. Hopefully after reading this you'll have a good understanding on what good passwords look like, how hackers actually crack your passwords and how you can stay secure. 

### Password: password 

I think we can all agree that using "password" for your password is not a good idea. Most websites won't even let you use that password without throwing in some numbers and symbols. But how are hackers able to figure out your password? It seems every other month there is a major security breach at a company, and millions of peoples' information is compromised. How is the website actually storing these passwords for protection?

When we talk about cyber security, one aspect of it that we are concerned about is the integrity of data. This means that we expect the orginal data that was sent, to be the exact same data that is received on the other end. If you've played the game "Telephone" as a kid in school, this is exactly the purpose of the game. The orginal phrase is passed down from kid to kid, and the last person has to relay the same information to see if the orginal phrase held true. Sounds easy, right?(Hint: It's not) Similar to how kids will purposely alter the phrase to be funny, hackers will alter data in mid transit to corrupt the integrity of the data for their personal benefit.

What does this have to do with passwords though? 

If we can manage to come up with a way to maintain the integrity of data in cyber space, we can effectively ensure that the data is kept in its original form without fear of being altered. We can do the same for passwords, but the use case is slightly different.
