This question is probably one that is most asked when it comes to ensuring your various accounts are secure. Hopefully after reading this you'll have a good understanding on what good passwords look like, how hackers actually crack your passwords and how you can stay secure. 

### Password: password 

I think we can all agree that using "password" for your password is not a good idea. Most websites won't even let you use that password without throwing in some numbers and symbols. But how are hackers able to figure out your password? It seems every other month there is a major security breach at a company, and millions of peoples' information is compromised. How is the website actually storing these passwords for protection?

When you create a new account on a website, it asks you to create a password. Once you create the password and fill out the rest, your account is now active. But what's happenning in the background? Where did your password go?
