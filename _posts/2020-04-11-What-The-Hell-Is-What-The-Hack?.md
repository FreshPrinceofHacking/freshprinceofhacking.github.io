Judging by Nick Young's face, he's confused too...

This section is going to be dedicated to a different topic in each post that has to do with something cyber security related, or loosely based. I'm always taking suggestions, but topics will include (but not limited to):

* What is a VPN?

* What is Tor?

* What is Encryption?

* (insert your suggestion)

The main goal is to break down these different topics and explain them at a high level. I encourage you to do outside research on these topics as well, but these posts will get you started with the basics.
