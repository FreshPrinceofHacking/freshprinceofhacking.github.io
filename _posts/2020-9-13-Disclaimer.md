If you're reading this, chances are you're interested in seeing how hackers are able to actually able to do the things they do. Now, while I'm definitely not a pro-hacker, I will be showing hacking tools in this section that can be used to do some pretty crazy stuff. Under no circumstances do I encourage you to try these in the wild for fun. Everything I do will be in a controlled environment for proof of concept and nothing more. If used incorrectly, you can possibly go to jail for just the attempt or if you accidently damage a system you have no authority being in. 

That's all. Have fun reading! :)
