This probably will be one of the shortest articles of this section, but one of the most important ones. If you want to further protect your accounts on various websites, you will need to apply more security controls than just your username and password. Two-Factor Authentication(2FA) is the best way to do so. Hopefully after reading this you'll understand how 2FA works, and why you should enable it whenever possible.

### Enter Your Password

Long gone are the days of not worrying if hackers are able to gain access to your accounts. They will. It's not a matter of if, but when. Whether you get phished on accident through email, or if there is a data breach at a company, your credentials are going to get exposed in the hacker world for some nefarious purpose. Now before you panic, obviously this is a very grim look at cyber security controls and policies that are supposed to protect you from these things. However, a somewhat counterintuitive notion that exists within cyber security is that, "hackers are going to get through." Yes, you read that correctly. We should expect hackers to be able to get through security controls, but it doesn't mean they will be successful in the long run...

**Defense-in-Depth** is a cyber security principle that basically outlines a plan for your overall security infrastructure. These defenses can include things like physical security controls, cyber perimeter defenses(firwalls, IDS/IPS) and endpoint solutions (anti virus). All of these controls together will be your defenses against threats, both physical and in cyber space.

"Ok, but what does this have to do with my online accounts? I don't own a business, I just have facebook login."

We can apply defense-in-depth tactics to your online accounts as well.
