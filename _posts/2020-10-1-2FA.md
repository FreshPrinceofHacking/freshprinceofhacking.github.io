This probably will be one of the shortest articles I write, but one of the most important ones. If you want to further protect your accounts on various websites, you will need to apply more security controls than just your username and password. Two-Factor Authentication(2FA) is the best way to do so. Hopefully after reading this you'll understand how 2FA works, and why you should enable it whenever possible.
