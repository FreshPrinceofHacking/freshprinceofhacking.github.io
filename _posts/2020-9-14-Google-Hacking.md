What if I told you that you've been searching on google the wrong way all this time? Ok, maybe not the wrong way, but what if I told you that you can significantly enhance your google searches with just a few changes in your search queries, and a little bit of imagination? That sounds like a reasonable skill to have, and it's actually something that is easier than you'd think. In this article I'm going to go over google "hacking" and how you can use it to enhance your searches, as well as the implications it has on cyber security.
