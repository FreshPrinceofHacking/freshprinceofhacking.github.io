What if I told you that you've been searching on google the wrong way all this time? Ok, maybe not the wrong way, but what if I told you that you can significantly enhance your google searches with just a few changes in your search queries, and a little bit of creativity? That sounds like a reasonable skill to have, and it's actually something that is easier than you'd think. In this article I'm going to go over google "hacking" and how you can use it to enhance your searches, as well as the implications it has on cyber security.

### You're such a Dork

It's no secret that google is one of the largest and most popular search engines in the world. People rely on google every second to find resources related to their search queries. What other search engine can find you the best cat memes or best places to download $100+ textbooks for free? If you've read my [dark web](https://freshprinceofhacking.github.io/what%20the%20hack/What-Is-The-Dark-Web/) article, you'll remember that google and every other search engine are just indexing the various pages it finds, and organizes them for us to view. I hinted at the notion of how much information is actually indexed on the web for us to be able to simply search for. Hmm...this could be very valuable for hackers, but how?

Let's think about this. If google simply indexes all of the information it can find, surely some of that information is sensitive, right? Forget about the deep web. All of that information is more or less "protected."  What about the stuff that isn't? This information could include websites that might have vulnerabilities on them, internet facing webcams/cameras, and even plaintext lists that contain username/password information. If google indexed it, it's out there to find. 

"Wait, wait, wait Taylor. I can't just type in 'usernames and passwords for X site' into google, and it will give me the information."

Well, no. And not because the information isn't out there. You just typed it in the wrong way. Google has advanced search operators or **dorks** that you can enter into a search query, and potentially find you more specific results. This makes sense from a management perspective. Google is a very powerful search engine, and it's completely reasonable that they included advanced search operators in order for people to narrow search results from the billions upon billions of resources out there. Unfortunately, this means that it also applies to finding out sensitive information that is very useful to hackers. 

### Try Searching For...

Let's back up for a second and talk about normal searches.
