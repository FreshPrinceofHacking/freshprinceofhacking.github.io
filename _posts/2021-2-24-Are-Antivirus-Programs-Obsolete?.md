As you're probably aware, cyber security has largely been commodified, which means there's a whole bunch of products that companies are selling to try to get you to enhance your cyber security posture. This includes things like antivirus software. But is antivirus software still relevant in 2021? And if so, which one should you buy? In this article, we'll go through what exactly these programs do to protect you, if you should buy one and the larger implications they have on cyber security. 

### Can I have your signature?

In order for an antivirus program to be successful it needs to catch viruses. Well duh...but how exactly are viruses caught? You can't throw a pokeball at it and it's contained. With the vast amount of virus types out there, it would be great if we could identify them based on **what they look like from the inside**. A virus in its basic form is just a piece of computer code. The code contains the rules and properties for how that particular virus is going to operate. This means that all an antivirus program would have to do is look for specific areas in the code that can identify it as malicious and call it a day. This is called a **signature based approach**. 

Let's take a step back and think about a real world scenario. Imagine you're in a warehouse of hundreds of boxes, and your task is to try to categorize them based on the item inside. You may find very unique items or repeated items in every box you look through. Once you're done, you write up all the items you found in the boxes and enter them into a database. Now while that's a pain in the ass to do, this is exactly what virus/malware researchers do to investigate these threats.

Instead of boxes, researchers will analyze virues/malware patterns and try to find a common signature to identify them.
