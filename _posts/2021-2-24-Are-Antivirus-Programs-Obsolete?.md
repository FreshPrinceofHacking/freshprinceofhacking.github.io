As you're probably aware, cyber security has largely been commodified, which means there's a whole bunch of products that companies are selling to try to get you to enhance your cyber security posture. This includes things like antivirus software. But is antivirus software still relevant in 2021? And if so, which one should you buy? In this article, we'll go through what exactly these programs do to protect you, if you should buy one and the larger implications they have on cyber security. 

### Can I have your signature?

In order for an antivirus program to be successful it needs to catch viruses. Well duh...but how exactly are viruses caught? You can't throw a pokeball at it and it's contained. With the vast amount of virus types out there, it would be great if we could identify them based on previously seen viruses that we know exist. If an antivirus program sees, what it suspects to be, a virus come in and it matches a virus in the database, it can quickly identify it as malicious. This is called a **signature based approach**.

Malware/virus researchers will try to reverse engineer a new virus they see, try to figure out its behavior and then create a signature for it. You can think of a signature like a footprint or some other labeling that can help to identify it in the future. A signature is usually made up of particular data points in the virus code that could contain the malicious behavior. The signature is then put into a database of other known viruses of the antivirus program. If this virus is seen in the future by the program, it will know to block it and/or remove it from your computer.
