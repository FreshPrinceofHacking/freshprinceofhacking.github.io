As you're probably aware, cyber security has largely been commodified, which means there's a whole bunch of products that companies are selling to try to get you to enhance your cyber security posture. This includes things like antivirus software. But is antivirus software still relevant in 2021? And if so, which one should you buy? In this article, we'll go through what exactly these programs do to protect you, if you should buy one and the larger implications they have on cyber security. 

### Can I have your signature?

In order for an antivirus program to be successful it needs to catch viruses. Well duh...but how exactly are viruses caught? You can't throw a pokeball at it and it's contained. With the vast amount of virus types out there, it would be great if we could identify them based on **what they look like from the inside**. A virus in its basic form is just a piece of computer code. The code contains the rules and properties for how that particular virus is going to operate. This means that all an antivirus program would potentially have to do is look for specific areas in the virus code that can identify it as malicious and then block it. This is called a **signature based approach**. 

Analogous to a police investigator using a footprint or blood sample to identify a suspect, malware/virus researchers will try to reverse engineer a new virus they see and determine its signature. The signature is then put into a database of other known viruses of the antivirus program. If this virus is seen in the future by the program, it will know to block it and/or remove it from your computer.
