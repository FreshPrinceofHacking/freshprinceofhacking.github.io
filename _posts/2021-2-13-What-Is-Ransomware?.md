Ransomware has easily become one of the most popular cyber security threats over the last few years(although been around for much longer). It has affected every industry you can think of: education, finance, municipal, etc. and it doesn't look like attacks are slowing down anytime soon. In this article we will dive into what exactly ransomware is and how you can protect yourself from it. 

### Ransom Note

Probably somewhat of an obvious motivation for hackers is financial gain. We've seen countless times in the news (or you may have experienced it yourself) when hackers have stolen credit card information, or other financial documents in order to get some sort of monetary value out of their hack. In fact, it is estimated that by 2025 cybercrime is going to cost the world up to [10.5 trillion dollars annually](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/). That's not a small number. That's about roughly 1/9th of the world's GDP, and about **half of the United State's GDP**. 

Sure, a high profile person with wealth(Bill Gates, Elon Musk, etc.) might sound like the best target to gain a lot of money very fast. However, the feasibility of erasing wealth from that one person is quite slim if they're aware of where their money is at all times and keep a generally clean cyber environment. Instead, hackers are targeting organizations that are worth value in order to make money. How can you cripple an entire organization though? Well...by "kidnapping" their valued assets, they may be more receptive in paying the kidnappers to get them back. 

When it comes to hacking, we need to think more broadly about what represents value. Just like in the real world we have things that are worth value depending on who the thing belongs to; jewelry, artifacts, shoes, etc. If we're theives in the real world, this is what we may target. In cyber space things change a bit. Confidential documents and intellectual property may be the companies high valued assets, in which a hacker is going to try to target. Individuals are also at risk in cyber space, as we all have documents and things we consider valuable.

Let's say you woke up one day and were presented with this screen at your desktop:

Your first reaction would probably be one of shock, but maybe disbelief. You then try to access files on your computer and they are all "locked" and now the panic sets in. You've been hit with ransomware. This is the exact prompt many companies and individuals were hit with back in 2017 when the **WannaCry Ransomware** attack made its way into the cyber world. This attack was highly distributed and just one of many ransomwares out there that have affected people. We'll break down the components of ransomware in the next section.
