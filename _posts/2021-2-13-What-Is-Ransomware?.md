Ransomware has easily become one of the most popular cyber security threats over the last few years. It has affected every industry you can think of: education, finance, municipal, etc. and it doesn't look like attacks are slowing down anytime soon. In this article we will dive into what exactly ransomware is and how you can protect yourself from it. 

### Ransom Note

Probably somewhat of an obvious motivation for hackers is financial gain. We've seen countless times in the news (or you may have experienced it yourself) when hackers have stolen credit card information, or other financial documents in order to get some sort of monetary value out of their hack. In fact, it is estimated that by 2025 cybercrime is going to cost the world up to [10.5 trillion dollars annually](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/). That's not a small number. That's about roughly 1/9th of the world's GDP, and about **half of the United State's GDP**. 

Sure, a high profile person with wealth(Bill Gates, Elon Musk, etc.) might sound like the best target to gain a lot of money very fast. However, the feasibility of erasing wealth from that one person is quite slim if they're aware of where their money is at all times and keep a generally clean cyber environment. Instead, hackers are targeting organizations that are worth value in order to make money. How can you cripple an entire organization though? Well...by "kidnapping" their valued assets, they may be more receptive in paying the kidnappers to get them back. 

When it comes to hacking, we need to think more broadly about what represents value. Just like in the real world we have things that are worth value depending on who the thing belongs to; jewelry, artifacts, shoes, etc. In cyber space things change a bit. Now we're after things like confidential documents and intellectual property. All things that the company has deemed valuable to them and their needs.
