Encryption is one of the most fundamental parts of modern computing. It's the reason why your credit card information isn't stolen every time you buy something online (well at least as infrequently as possible). So what is it? How does it work? We could probably spend an entire semester on encryption, but we don't have that kind of time. Hopefully after reading this, you'll understand what it is, and why it matters when it comes to cyber security.

In order to understand encryption, we first need to understand **cryptography.** Cryptography, simply put, is the study/art of writing or solving codes. That's it. This fundamental idea of being able to either write and/or solve codes is the reason why modern computing exists in its current state. However, cryptography has existed thousands of years before any electronic computer was made. In the example above, I used a **ceasar ciper**, which you might guess is named after Julius Ceasar, in order to encrypt the subject title. While it may look cryptic (yes, pun intended), this cipher or encoding method, is very simple to solve.

The way that a ceasar cipher works is through a series of shifts or substitutions of the alphabet to a fixed position. In other words, all you're doing is shifting the alphabet by a certain number of characters to come up with your encoded message. From here on out we will refer
